These algorithms are widely applicable in various domains such as school admissions, job assignments, and resource allocation problems. Their effectiveness in creating stable and efficient matchings makes them valuable tools in economics, computer science and operations research.","version":"0.1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":25275598,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"be4edc6f772159413b82f5fbd3cb224b056dbf5615e16814a22a3c975a61f529","md5":"8cbe6b9f3bd62d9f35db19434b049840","sha256":"c39cf925e047efeef4de098d8546ea0b92f823dd08660940221ba1ab4b12e6c3"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"matching_algorithms-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"8cbe6b9f3bd62d9f35db19434b049840","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.6","size":16010,"upload_time":"2024-10-01T15:15:14","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-10-01T15:15:14.297251Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/be/4e/dc6f772159413b82f5fbd3cb224b056dbf5615e16814a22a3c975a61f529/matching_algorithms-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"beda1109947cb06868aa7f35a8c1539d71ef40212cec73734c5f43ebaaaaba3e","md5":"ed3700b054336dc846244079088d3a06","sha256":"c5540d76d1491cc68a0957ee876dab460b7097494195ca796a47926f00c864ce"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"matching_algorithms-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"ed3700b054336dc846244079088d3a06","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.6","size":32218,"upload_time":"2024-10-01T15:15:16","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-10-01T15:15:16.283324Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/be/da/1109947cb06868aa7f35a8c1539d71ef40212cec73734c5f43ebaaaaba3e/matching_algorithms-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
