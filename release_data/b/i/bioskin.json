It also contains several practical applications, as well as a gui to perform interactive edits directly over the estimated skin properties","version":"1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":25792780,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"03a311c96d6c55b8de2d18e8c26f94db5527fb03de0ef570ca427771460f72c4","md5":"64db275b4b98e6197c3d6ee1f50f31ec","sha256":"2e64933c6683f8144caa79ac30067f92829797d8f5d0d460121dcc6a5ecd63f2"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"bioskin-1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"64db275b4b98e6197c3d6ee1f50f31ec","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.8","size":91550,"upload_time":"2024-11-02T12:03:00","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-11-02T12:03:00.913001Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/03/a3/11c96d6c55b8de2d18e8c26f94db5527fb03de0ef570ca427771460f72c4/bioskin-1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"8f3ddd18ce4c1806c0b74bb599d56b08dc1fd2fcfc1a1ddeb8af25397afc9a9f","md5":"e737221fa52119f918e7ec34df839257","sha256":"c85125ca59905ffdd57780a17df2f4f4ff44acbb9d753ef8ccad750367cbda9d"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"bioskin-1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"e737221fa52119f918e7ec34df839257","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.8","size":68944,"upload_time":"2024-11-02T12:03:02","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-11-02T12:03:02.748989Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8f/3d/dd18ce4c1806c0b74bb599d56b08dc1fd2fcfc1a1ddeb8af25397afc9a9f/bioskin-1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
