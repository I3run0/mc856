Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability  While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.  _END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS_  ### APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work  To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets `[]` replaced with your own identifying information.
