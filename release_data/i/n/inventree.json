However, it is a vulnerability that the InvenTree development team takes seriously.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proposed patch for this vulnerability is prevents injection of un-escaped fields into front-end UI elements.\n\nA future patch will also address sanitization of database fields on the \"back end\", however this will require a much larger effort to refactor multiple database tables.\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue is addressed in the upcoming `0.8.0` release\n- This fix will also be back-ported to the `0.7.x` branch, applied to the `0.7.2` release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for this issue, users should upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### References\n\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/4cae8442-c042-43c2-ad89-6f666eaf3d57/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/9d640ef2-c52c-4106-b043-f7497d577078/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/b114e82f-6c02-485b-82ea-e242f89169c2/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/22783cd3-1b2c-48fc-b31f-03b53c86da0b/\n\nThank you @saharshtapi for bringing this issue to our attention and giving pointers for fixing them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github](http://github.com/inventree/inventree)\n* Email us at [security@inventree.org](mailto:security@inventree.org)\n","fixed_in":["0.7.2"],"id":"GHSA-rm89-9g65-4ffr","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-rm89-9g65-4ffr","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null},{"aliases":[],"details":"### Impact\n\nDatasets exported to file (e.g. CSV / XLS) are not sufficiently sanitized, to neutralize potential formula injection\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue is addressed in the upcoming 0.8.0 release\n- This fix will also be back-ported to the 0.7.x branch, applied to the 0.7.2 release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers exporting untrusted data should open the files in safe mode (e.g. in Microsoft Excel).\n\n### References\n\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/e57c36e7-fa39-435f-944a-3a52ee066f73/\n- https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github](http://github.com/inventree/inventree)\n* Email us at [security@inventree.org](mailto:security@inventree.org)\n","fixed_in":["0.7.2"],"id":"GHSA-7rq4-qcpw-74gq","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-7rq4-qcpw-74gq","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null},{"aliases":["CVE-2022-2111"],"details":"### Impact\n\nInvenTree allows unrestricted upload of files as attachments to various database fields.
