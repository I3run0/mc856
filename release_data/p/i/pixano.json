Any or\n        all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms\n        and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work\n        and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the\n        distribution of said Initial Software.\n        \n        The Holder undertakes that the Initial Software will remain ruled at\n        least by this Agreement, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2.\n        \n        \n              6.2 OVER THE INTEGRATED CONTRIBUTIONS\n        \n        The Licensee who develops an Integrated Contribution is the owner of the\n        intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by\n        applicable law.\n        \n        \n              6.3 OVER THE RELATED MODULES\n        \n        The Licensee who develops a Related Module is the owner of the\n        intellectual property rights over this Related Module as defined by\n        applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall\n        govern its distribution under the conditions defined in Article 5.3.3.\n        \n        \n              6.4 NOTICE OF RIGHTS\n        \n        The Licensee expressly undertakes:\n        \n           1. not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property\n              notices attached to the Software;\n        \n           2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies\n              of the Software modified or not;\n        \n           3. to ensure that use of the Software, its intellectual property\n              notices and the fact that it is governed by the Agreement is\n              indicated in a text that is easily accessible, specifically from\n              the interface of any Derivative Software.\n        \n        The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the\n        intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors on the\n        Software and to take, where applicable, vis-Ã -vis its staff, any and all\n        measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual property rights\n        of the Holder and/or Contributors.\n        \n        \n            Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES\n        \n        7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to\n        provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.\n        \n        However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The\n        terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such\n        maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the\n        Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services\n        shall incur liability therefor.\n        \n        7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under\n        its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon\n        itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified\n        Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said\n        warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,\n        shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor\n        and the Licensee.\n        \n        \n            Article 8 - LIABILITY\n        \n        8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be\n        entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered\n        from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant\n        Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.\n        \n        8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under\n        this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:\n        (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its\n        obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the\n        Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more\n        generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly\n        agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,\n        loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,\n        opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all\n        legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,\n        shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to\n        any or all compensation from the Licensor.\n        \n        \n            Article 9 - WARRANTY\n        \n        9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical\n        state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all\n        possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of\n        possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's\n        attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,\n        modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are\n        reserved for experienced users.\n        \n        The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,\n        the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working\n        order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons\n        or properties.\n        \n        9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled\n        to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the\n        rights set forth in Article 5).\n        \n        9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \"as is\" by\n        the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than\n        that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty\n        as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant\n        nature.\n        \n        Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free\n        from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will\n        be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software\n        configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.\n        \n        9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the\n        Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right\n        relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,\n        the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee\n        arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be\n        instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the\n        Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against\n        the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal\n        assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be\n        decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the\n        Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor\n        disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the\n        name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of\n        prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence\n        of a trademark.\n        \n        \n            Article 10 - TERMINATION\n        \n        10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations\n        hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement\n        thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has\n        remained ineffective.\n        \n        10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be\n        authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any\n        licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement\n        shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance\n        with the terms and conditions hereof.\n        \n        \n            Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS\n        \n        \n              11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS\n        \n        Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to\n        perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force\n        majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective\n        functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications\n        networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by\n        government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,\n        fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.\n        \n        11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke\n        one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be\n        interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to\n        invoke said provision(s) subsequently.\n        \n        11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,\n        whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same\n        purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said\n        Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the\n        terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties\n        unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized\n        representatives.\n        \n        11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to\n        conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,\n        said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make\n        the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative\n        text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity\n        of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not\n        cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.\n        \n        \n              11.5 LANGUAGE\n        \n        The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions\n        are deemed authentic.\n        \n        \n            Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT\n        \n        12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this\n        Agreement.\n        \n        12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is\n        protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who\n        reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the\n        Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may\n        address new issues encountered by Free Software.\n        \n        12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may\n        only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement\n        or a subsequent version.\n        \n        \n            Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\n        \n        13.1 The Agreement is governed by French law.

Preamble  The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.  The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make available to the community the modifications made to the source code of the software so as to contribute to its evolution.  In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.  In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.  This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.   Article 1 - DEFINITIONS  For the purpose of this Agreement, when the following expressions commence with a capital letter, they shall have the following meaning:  Agreement: means this license agreement, and its possible subsequent versions and annexes.

The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors on the Software and to take, where applicable, vis-Ã -vis its staff, any and all measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors.   Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES  7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.  However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services shall incur liability therefor.  7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application, shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor and the Licensee.   Article 8 - LIABILITY  8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.  8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular: (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data, loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders, opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party, shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to any or all compensation from the Licensor.   Article 9 - WARRANTY  9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are reserved for experienced users.  The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or properties.  9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the rights set forth in Article 5).  9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied \"as is\" by the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant nature.  Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.  9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore, the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence of a trademark.   Article 10 - TERMINATION  10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective.  10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof.   Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS   11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS  Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.  11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.  11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.  11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.   11.5 LANGUAGE  The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions are deemed authentic.   Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT  12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this Agreement.  12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues encountered by Free Software.  12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement or a subsequent version.   Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION  13.1 The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to endeavor to seek an amicable solution to any disagreements or disputes that may arise during the performance of the Agreement.  13.2 Failing an amicable solution within two (2) months as from their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having jurisdiction, by the more diligent Party.
