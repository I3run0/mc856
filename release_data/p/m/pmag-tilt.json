(2023). However, it can also be used for the following applications: converting unit vectors from XYZ to polar coordinates and vice versa, finding the angle between vectors (directions), APWP interpolation, and wherever the goal is to find the amount of tilt (or folding) by comparing paleomagnetic directions.","version":"1.0.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":18431951,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"b8557400c5190ce6be224fd54d4c0d938d8f2c3aed1e7345f6349135cc382023","md5":"7e23252c62fb56243b774ff3515aae8d","sha256":"efb94483fd03d8b746fb4e55cb1d22f7abf32d9ce211f83923030765960e07a8"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pmag_tilt-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"7e23252c62fb56243b774ff3515aae8d","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.7","size":6032,"upload_time":"2023-06-08T22:58:55","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-06-08T22:58:55.238285Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b8/55/7400c5190ce6be224fd54d4c0d938d8f2c3aed1e7345f6349135cc382023/pmag_tilt-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"eeb01b7bc4cd9ab8cd36fdcab654e8b289b6c9f113f706cbb1624fbe122f10f1","md5":"cb69b77a0c8395ab8ee6b91e5bf806a9","sha256":"dda8a11a9cf163bcb2f923f4ec89ffbbb220838bc1e13ab24c49dee1e711c33c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pmag_tilt-1.0.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"cb69b77a0c8395ab8ee6b91e5bf806a9","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.7","size":5095,"upload_time":"2023-06-08T22:58:56","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-06-08T22:58:56.428002Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ee/b0/1b7bc4cd9ab8cd36fdcab654e8b289b6c9f113f706cbb1624fbe122f10f1/pmag_tilt-1.0.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
