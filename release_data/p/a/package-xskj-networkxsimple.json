At the same time, this module also inherits all the methods of network and does not affect the normal function calls of networkX.","version":"0.1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":22688702,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"7e747b0bc01b5c9141ad0530a4081fd2fa72c5c378b46a93a22d5eb04c754cea","md5":"987b79cdb4b7e121b46be25823f7856c","sha256":"53e490376eac01b5296ad213b26d9d628124f17cce64c2c58933212446e4ff9a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"package_xskj_NetworkXsimple-0.1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"987b79cdb4b7e121b46be25823f7856c","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py2.py3","requires_python":">=3.6.0","size":8702,"upload_time":"2024-04-09T19:11:23","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-04-09T19:11:23.354315Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7e/74/7b0bc01b5c9141ad0530a4081fd2fa72c5c378b46a93a22d5eb04c754cea/package_xskj_NetworkXsimple-0.1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"837f333c9298b093f03377371a5b0da8249267d66b3bdb1f34f9a7be1199a0e2","md5":"8613cd3eb10406aecfc60b437856b91f","sha256":"39dc7ed29bc2065ed3bef2ddc7236fc4746263d55703b661e445362454f6c84c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"package_xskj_NetworkXsimple-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"8613cd3eb10406aecfc60b437856b91f","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.6.0","size":9445,"upload_time":"2024-04-09T19:11:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-04-09T19:11:25.314650Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/83/7f/333c9298b093f03377371a5b0da8249267d66b3bdb1f34f9a7be1199a0e2/package_xskj_NetworkXsimple-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
