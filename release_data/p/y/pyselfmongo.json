A client is written as a singleton to make sure that only one connection is open at a time. The connection timeout is taken care by checking the server info every time a request is made. A new connection is made if the server info is not available or the connection has timed out.","version":"0.1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":13584058,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"c10cc8f25d6fa69f882c2f19e967fdd4acfc67518b7af2663650e68cd1e7c4b1","md5":"ef3e3a8e1d77440a57b04c8371d4b18e","sha256":"3a0cce68543f9415e2468151ebc8c9410e0c9bda8c0bd7d9c48f2cb2c5a5f471"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"PySelfMongo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"ef3e3a8e1d77440a57b04c8371d4b18e","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.10,<4.0","size":4569,"upload_time":"2022-04-21T21:49:15","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-04-21T21:49:15.693717Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c1/0c/c8f25d6fa69f882c2f19e967fdd4acfc67518b7af2663650e68cd1e7c4b1/PySelfMongo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"17e18e426f6b7e40020a386d6dd11ff865f760a39dbe1df7002c63226a6e2367","md5":"3dfec352101e9ea3e55c168df9d157ff","sha256":"81b112885dc536154316e83623c7430d268db8292ad11220b8d4165077c26b6c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"PySelfMongo-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"3dfec352101e9ea3e55c168df9d157ff","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.10,<4.0","size":4356,"upload_time":"2022-04-21T21:49:17","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-04-21T21:49:17.040419Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/17/e1/8e426f6b7e40020a386d6dd11ff865f760a39dbe1df7002c63226a6e2367/PySelfMongo-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
