This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../' when serving static files. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system. \n\n### References\n- https://github.com/widgetti/solara/security/advisories/GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w\n- https://github.com/widgetti/solara/commit/df2fd66a7f4e8ffd36e8678697a8a4f76760dc54\n- https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-39903","fixed_in":["1.35.1"],"id":"GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null}]},"1.40.0":{"info":{"author":null,"author_email":"\"Maarten A.
