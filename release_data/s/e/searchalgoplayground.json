It also provides a way to save the graph in json format hence enabling the programmers to share the files and use different algorithm on same graph with ease.","version":"1.0.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":11726399,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"edb657893ba5e30b955c9a0b8657e8f5c4d447dd1e7267e646300c8a2ddca8be","md5":"1fffc7fd4900b2756785352bbcf3c831","sha256":"189d30cc38d873ac46449541d60f06e12c0f135b5c45748e57e6154151fc5ee6"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"SearchAlgoPlayground-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"1fffc7fd4900b2756785352bbcf3c831","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.6","size":85824,"upload_time":"2021-10-14T16:10:07","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-10-14T16:10:07.220883Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ed/b6/57893ba5e30b955c9a0b8657e8f5c4d447dd1e7267e646300c8a2ddca8be/SearchAlgoPlayground-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"8a9ea868592cbd409493f7c9247c65484f12f1c7ae24dc746df208168e849a9d","md5":"cf84afb3802443e571370eaf7c18fdf8","sha256":"23aac5ffc7baf7f041d0b9231763d11c312df51da329c4b7daf08e12e84092e4"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"SearchAlgoPlayground-1.0.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"cf84afb3802443e571370eaf7c18fdf8","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.6","size":99026,"upload_time":"2021-10-14T16:10:10","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-10-14T16:10:10.428890Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8a/9e/a868592cbd409493f7c9247c65484f12f1c7ae24dc746df208168e849a9d/SearchAlgoPlayground-1.0.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
