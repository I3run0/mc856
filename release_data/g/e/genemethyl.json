For numerous samples of a specific disease, you can get a correlation value between gene expression levels and summations calculated from DNA methylation beta-values. Additionally you can simply know beta-value distribution by density plot.","version":"1.0.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":4367941,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"23eb235f9bcce2a6877381cafcb746712b4cf14f3bdf272528c776268d198ab7","md5":"b78569d3a61d2d480c94d009e93c614d","sha256":"953c198827065b022659c7c0547daee35ca8d374e8e4b3653c2d6bb503740cc1"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"GeneMethyl-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"b78569d3a61d2d480c94d009e93c614d","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":17418,"upload_time":"2018-10-12T09:39:36","upload_time_iso_8601":"2018-10-12T09:39:36.830580Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/23/eb/235f9bcce2a6877381cafcb746712b4cf14f3bdf272528c776268d198ab7/GeneMethyl-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"4d755b48c6690faecb451dd5f0547da4dfe39f887742fb85f7db8df4ac92524d","md5":"5b1e9b074d35770161e4daf78ba43ee2","sha256":"7ae4042d2f7a7a2531bd587d6640a7fe5f99a3fb1f3abd531294568bb3954c76"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"GeneMethyl-1.0.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5b1e9b074d35770161e4daf78ba43ee2","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":10210,"upload_time":"2018-10-12T09:39:38","upload_time_iso_8601":"2018-10-12T09:39:38.387370Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4d/75/5b48c6690faecb451dd5f0547da4dfe39f887742fb85f7db8df4ac92524d/GeneMethyl-1.0.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
