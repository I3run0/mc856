The vulnerability is related to the embedding model update feature under admin settings. When a user updates the model path, the system checks if the file exists and provides different error messages based on the existence and configuration of the file. This behavior allows an attacker to enumerate file names and traverse directories by observing the error messages, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.","fixed_in":[],"id":"GHSA-mq92-jr35-ffpc","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-mq92-jr35-ffpc","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null}]},"0.3.20":{"info":{"author":null,"author_email":"Timothy Jaeryang Baek <tim@openwebui.com>","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":["Development Status :: 4 - Beta","License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License","Programming Language :: Python :: 3","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11","Topic :: Communications :: Chat","Topic :: Multimedia"],"description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":null,"keywords":null,"license":"MIT License  Copyright (c) 2023 Timothy Jaeryang Baek  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
