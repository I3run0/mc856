Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"jupyter-server-signaling","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-server-signaling/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-server-signaling/","project_urls":null,"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-server-signaling/0.1.9/","requires_dist":["jupyter-server<3.0.0,>=2.4.0","websockets"],"requires_python":">=3.8","summary":"jupyter-server extension for WebRTC signaling.","version":"0.1.9","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":25535862,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"fd3f03e28fc3b4f7015e3a2043fe0a0af81fcd5847e1549769491723721b055f","md5":"3dd8807d625c36e67e7b187deaa75583","sha256":"1afbabc52b81964e9b620463daad0089e2a8f9e53ef4e1ed32e7a40315391ab6"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"jupyter_server_signaling-0.1.9-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"3dd8807d625c36e67e7b187deaa75583","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.8","size":7077,"upload_time":"2024-10-17T21:03:14","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-10-17T21:03:14.527715Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fd/3f/03e28fc3b4f7015e3a2043fe0a0af81fcd5847e1549769491723721b055f/jupyter_server_signaling-0.1.9-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"fadc8919b8d389f7a6f7d9c090f01fa2d1c1518e63e2db68106b85f36354dec3","md5":"bdd929dda8375748b976fa8480efc415","sha256":"8aa677bed172f7ef34cba6aa450adb298543b2530c5c0f9a5093de60f12a1f79"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"jupyter_server_signaling-0.1.9.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"bdd929dda8375748b976fa8480efc415","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.8","size":5187,"upload_time":"2024-10-17T21:03:19","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-10-17T21:03:19.412190Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fa/dc/8919b8d389f7a6f7d9c090f01fa2d1c1518e63e2db68106b85f36354dec3/jupyter_server_signaling-0.1.9.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
