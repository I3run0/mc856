However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n\t      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n\t      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n\t      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n\t      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n\t      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\t\r\n\t   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\t\r\n\t   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\t\r\n\t      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n\t      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n\t      replaced with your own identifying information.

Limitation of Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n\t      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n\t      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n\t      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n\t      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n\t      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\t\r\n\t   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\t\r\n\t   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\t\r\n\t      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n\t      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n\t      replaced with your own identifying information.
