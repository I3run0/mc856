This can lead to user data theft, session hijacking, malware distribution, and phishing attacks.","fixed_in":[],"id":"PYSEC-2024-61","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2024-61","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null},{"aliases":["CVE-2024-6255"],"details":"A vulnerability in the JSON file handling of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt version 20240410 allows any user to delete any JSON file on the server, including critical configuration files such as `config.json` and `ds_config_chatbot.json`. This issue arises due to improper validation of file paths, enabling directory traversal attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disrupt the functioning of the system, manipulate settings, or potentially cause data loss or corruption.","fixed_in":[],"id":"PYSEC-2024-73","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2024-73","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null},{"aliases":["CVE-2024-8143"],"details":"In the latest version (20240628) of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt, an issue exists in the /file endpoint that allows authenticated users to access the chat history of other users. When a user logs in, a directory is created in the history folder with the user's name. By manipulating the /file endpoint, an authenticated user can enumerate and access files in other users' directories, leading to unauthorized access to private chat histories. This vulnerability can be exploited to read any user's private chat history.","fixed_in":[],"id":"PYSEC-2024-113","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2024-113","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null},{"aliases":["CVE-2024-7962"],"details":"An arbitrary file read vulnerability exists in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt version 20240628 due to insufficient validation when loading prompt template files.
