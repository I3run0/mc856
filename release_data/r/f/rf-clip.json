It can be instructed in natural language to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an image, without directly optimizing for the task, similarly to the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-2 and 3. We found CLIP matches the performance of the original ResNet50 on ImageNet “zero-shot” without using any of the original 1.28M labeled examples, overcoming several major challenges in computer vision.","version":"1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":24499688,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"f5bc0fb5883f1e4511ad8661bb17679a7470e1f73b28736248b3318256335aa5","md5":"0b8000b7db1337f4a1252b7ba8f4fe29","sha256":"0ff53fac9a5396ef0dc49b1215c4a70ec925b4d07d0dccc104c1541e3ebe954a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"rf_clip-1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"0b8000b7db1337f4a1252b7ba8f4fe29","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":1369866,"upload_time":"2023-08-31T17:37:55","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-08-31T17:37:55.666929Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f5/bc/0fb5883f1e4511ad8661bb17679a7470e1f73b28736248b3318256335aa5/rf_clip-1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]},"1.1":{"info":{"author":"OpenAI","author_email":null,"bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":[],"description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":null,"keywords":null,"license":null,"maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"rf-clip","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/rf-clip/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/rf-clip/","project_urls":null,"provides_extra":["dev"],"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/rf-clip/1.1/","requires_dist":["ftfy","packaging","regex","tqdm","torch","torchvision","pytest; extra == \"dev\""],"requires_python":null,"summary":null,"version":"1.1","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":24499688,"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"c45aa26dda918259a9c89cf690b3c26cf43df656378da2dc8fdebc96ed87f2a4","md5":"91c618070921189e1335939261b89334","sha256":"c800aead16b0dd6f09004cb4510918e0d1b62c5690bba8db726931645d2a5e75"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"rf_clip-1.1-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"91c618070921189e1335939261b89334","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":1369526,"upload_time":"2024-08-09T11:27:40","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-08-09T11:27:40.241607Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c4/5a/a26dda918259a9c89cf690b3c26cf43df656378da2dc8fdebc96ed87f2a4/rf_clip-1.1-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
