This vulnerability results in the inability of users to add new components in certain categories (e.g., 'Image Builder') and to register new stacks through the UI, thereby degrading the user experience and potentially rendering the ZenML Dashboard unusable.

This vulnerability results in the inability of users to add new components in certain categories (e.g., 'Image Builder') and to register new stacks through the UI, thereby degrading the user experience and potentially rendering the ZenML Dashboard unusable.

When a low-privileged user adds a component through the API endpoint `api/v1/workspaces/default/components` with a name containing a `\\n` character, it leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. This vulnerability results in the inability of users to add new components in certain categories (e.g., 'Image Builder') and to register new stacks through the UI, thereby degrading the user experience and potentially rendering the ZenML Dashboard unusable. The issue does not affect component addition through the Web UI, as `\\n` characters are properly escaped in that context.

When a low-privileged user adds a component through the API endpoint `api/v1/workspaces/default/components` with a name containing a `\\n` character, it leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. This vulnerability results in the inability of users to add new components in certain categories (e.g., 'Image Builder') and to register new stacks through the UI, thereby degrading the user experience and potentially rendering the ZenML Dashboard unusable. The issue does not affect component addition through the Web UI, as `\\n` characters are properly escaped in that context. The vulnerability was tested on ZenML running in Docker, and it was observed in both Firefox and Chrome browsers.","fixed_in":["0.57.1"],"id":"GHSA-7gjr-hcc3-xfr4","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-7gjr-hcc3-xfr4","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null}]},"0.57.1":{"info":{"author":"ZenML GmbH","author_email":"info@zenml.io","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":["Development Status :: 4 - Beta","Intended Audience :: Developers","Intended Audience :: Science/Research","Intended Audience :: System Administrators","License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License","Programming Language :: Python :: 3","Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9","Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules","Topic :: System :: Distributed Computing","Typing :: Typed"],"description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://zenml.io","keywords":"machine learning, production, pipeline, mlops, devops","license":"Apache-2.0","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"zenml","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zenml/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zenml/","project_urls":{"Documentation":"https://docs.zenml.io","Homepage":"https://zenml.io","Repository":"https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zenml/0.57.1/","requires_dist":["alembic<1.9.0,>=1.8.1","bcrypt==4.0.1","click<8.1.4,>=8.0.1","click-params<0.4.0,>=0.3.0","cloudpickle<3,>=2.0.0","distro<2.0.0,>=1.6.0","docker<6.2.0,>=6.1.0","httplib2<0.20,>=0.19.1","gitpython<4.0.0,>=3.1.18","pandas>=1.1.5","passlib[bcrypt]<1.8.0,>=1.7.4","psutil>=5.0.0","pydantic<1.11,>=1.9.0","pymysql<1.1.0,>=1.0.2","pyparsing<3,>=2.4.0","python-dateutil<3.0.0,>=2.8.1","pyyaml>=6.0.1","rich[jupyter]>=12.0.0","secure<0.4.0,>=0.3.0","sqlalchemy_utils==0.38.3","sqlmodel==0.0.8","importlib_metadata<=7.0.0;

This issue was fixed in version 0.55.5. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient handling of concurrent user creation requests, leading to data inconsistencies and potential authentication problems. Specifically, concurrent processes may overwrite or corrupt user data, complicating user identification and posing security risks. This issue is particularly concerning for APIs that rely on usernames as input parameters, such as PUT /api/v1/users/test_race, where it could lead to further complications.","fixed_in":["0.55.5"],"id":"PYSEC-2024-105","link":"https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2024-105","source":"osv","summary":null,"withdrawn":null}]}}
