No Partnership or Agency. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership, joint venture or employment relations between the Parties, constitute a Party the agent of another Party, or authorize a Party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of any other Party.","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"amsdal_server","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_server/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_server/","project_urls":{"Documentation":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_server/#readme","Issues":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_server/","Source":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_server/"},"provides_extra":["otel"],"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_server/0.2.4/","requires_dist":["amsdal==0.2.*","asgi-correlation-id~=4.3","fastapi~=0.100","joblib==1.4.*","orjson~=3.9","pillow==10.3.*","pydantic-settings~=2.0","pydantic~=2.3","uvicorn~=0.23","opentelemetry-distro==0.48b0; extra == \"otel\"","opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.27.0; extra == \"otel\"","opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi==0.48b0; extra == \"otel\"","opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging==0.48b0; extra == \"otel\"","opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests==0.48b0; extra == \"otel\""],"requires_python":">=3.10","summary":"Rest API server for AMSDAL framework","version":"0.2.4","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":25856134,"urls":[{"comment_text":null,"digests":{"blake2b_256":"e99dafc3b029966aecfa8e47b9347cd88d41f46c2bcfccf105657a0ff6d204a8","md5":"7d1d549bb2df8bef31aa23dfb310b58d","sha256":"6986ea8d8ae0ec38eb52fd23f7c98832c8b9025680dd1c44d6eacc985fa2cc8c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"amsdal_server-0.2.4-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"7d1d549bb2df8bef31aa23dfb310b58d","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.10","size":88513,"upload_time":"2024-11-06T15:06:24","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-11-06T15:06:24.195159Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e9/9d/afc3b029966aecfa8e47b9347cd88d41f46c2bcfccf105657a0ff6d204a8/amsdal_server-0.2.4-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":null,"digests":{"blake2b_256":"70ce123c908575468b307979a0a4cbd7813d75c237ef853d84a98efcd2fcbdf1","md5":"bb1f829e4c43a429c729b73201ac471d","sha256":"d9b71bc0d35e77c0e57d52e0ca1bfd693403fc4db8025d85294249a96f93857a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"amsdal_server-0.2.4.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"bb1f829e4c43a429c729b73201ac471d","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.10","size":66690,"upload_time":"2024-11-06T15:06:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-11-06T15:06:25.740641Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/70/ce/123c908575468b307979a0a4cbd7813d75c237ef853d84a98efcd2fcbdf1/amsdal_server-0.2.4.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
