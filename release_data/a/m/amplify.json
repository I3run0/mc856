Amplify Corporation (“we”, “us”, “our”) to the User for use of Fixstars Amplify (“Service”), which provides Users with a software development environment and computational resources for solving mathematical optimization problems. There are two types of Service plans: the “Free plan” with certain restrictions on the scope of use, and the “Paid plan” with no such restrictions. Unless otherwise specified, these Terms apply to both plan types. Before using the Service, the User shall carefully read and agree to the entire text of these Terms of Use.
