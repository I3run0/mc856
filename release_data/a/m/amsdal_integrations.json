You shall comply with the U.S. Export Laws, as well as all applicable international and national laws related to the export or import regulations that apply in relation to your use of the Library.\n           12.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the Parties, supersede and extinguish all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.\n           12.3. Additional Agreements. AMSDAL and you are free to enter into any Additional Agreements. In the event of conflict, unless otherwise explicitly stated, the Additional Agreement shall control.\n           12.4. Modifications. We may modify, supplement or update this Agreement from time to time at our sole and absolute discretion. If we make changes to this Agreement, we will (i) update the “Version” and “Last Updated” date at the top of this Agreement and (ii) notify you in advance before the changes become effective. Your continued use of the Library is deemed acceptance of the amended Agreement. If you do not agree to any part of the amended Agreement, you shall immediately discontinue any use of the Library, which shall be your sole remedy.\n           12.5. Assignment. You shall not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent. We may upon prior written notice unilaterally transfer or assign this Agreement, including any rights and obligations hereunder at any time and no such transfer or assignment shall require your additional consent or approval.\n           12.6. Severance. If any provision or part-provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. If any provision or part-provision of this Agreement is deemed deleted under the previous sentence, AMSDAL will in good faith replace such provision with a new one that, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the intended commercial result of the original provision. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this Clause shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this Agreement.\n           12.7. Waiver. No failure or delay by a Party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.\n           12.8. No Partnership or Agency. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership, joint venture or employment relations between the Parties, constitute a Party the agent of another Party, or authorize a Party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of any other Party.","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"amsdal_integrations","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_integrations/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_integrations/","project_urls":{"Documentation":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_integrations/#readme","Issues":"https://github.com/amsdal/amsdal_integrations/issues","Source":"https://github.com/amsdal/amsdal_integrations"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/amsdal_integrations/0.0.5/","requires_dist":["httpx>=0.25.2"],"requires_python":">=3.7","summary":"AMSDAL Integrations - tools that allow integration to various ORM libraries to collect and send data to the AMSDAL application","version":"0.0.5","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":21742332,"urls":[{"comment_text":null,"digests":{"blake2b_256":"75c76120f99ddc6c5e3bf4e77a87903dd640c429a070d76e0efbeea85bb9766e","md5":"4ea3c56fe9184a33631d2426416bf583","sha256":"72154e65fc5eafabc874fc988399eee28b371b6de778acc35927affea95168e3"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"amsdal_integrations-0.0.5-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"4ea3c56fe9184a33631d2426416bf583","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.7","size":27498,"upload_time":"2024-02-05T13:19:47","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-02-05T13:19:47.546784Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/75/c7/6120f99ddc6c5e3bf4e77a87903dd640c429a070d76e0efbeea85bb9766e/amsdal_integrations-0.0.5-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":null,"digests":{"blake2b_256":"71994478eeaa2eff730bf8984f1b36491a58d98cf73539aa2a769afd4ff7bc62","md5":"19a9e6bd5791c07f25f0f8ab21a6732f","sha256":"b4df2064053dba490e90f1fc89f4c0e79f3b074d0cfbde427ab92c5726ce3626"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"amsdal_integrations-0.0.5.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"19a9e6bd5791c07f25f0f8ab21a6732f","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.7","size":24849,"upload_time":"2024-02-05T13:19:50","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-02-05T13:19:50.264328Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/71/99/4478eeaa2eff730bf8984f1b36491a58d98cf73539aa2a769afd4ff7bc62/amsdal_integrations-0.0.5.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}}
