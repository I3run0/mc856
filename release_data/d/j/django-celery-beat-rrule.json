To generate your own license, change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given here, and substitute your own.  Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite its colloquial name \"BSD New\", this is not the newest version of the BSD license; it was followed by the even newer BSD-2-Clause version, sometimes known as the \"Simplified BSD License\". On January 9th, 2008 the OSI Board approved BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and others. It omits the final \"no-endorsement\" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License.  Historical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had four clauses. The advertising clause (the third of four clauses) required you to acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in your advertising of any product using that code. It was officially rescinded by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999. He states that clause 3 is \"hereby deleted in its entirety.\" The four clause license has not been approved by OSI. The license below does not contain the advertising clause.  This prelude is not part of the license.  OWNER = Regents of the University of California  ORGANIZATION = University of California, Berkeley  YEAR = 1998  In the original BSD license, both occurrences of the phrase \"COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\" in the disclaimer read \"REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS\".
