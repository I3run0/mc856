Third Party Product / Open Source Software To the extent that the Product is provided to the User for which R&S has only derived rights to use (Third Party Product), the above Sections \"Grant of License\" and \"Restrictions\" shall – also concerning the relationship between R&S and the User – be amended and superseded by the conditions of use agreed between R&S and its licensor. To the extent that the User is provided with Open Source Software, the provisions of the above Sections \"Grant of License\" and \"Restrictions\" shall be amended and superseded by the conditions of use of the according Open Source Software. Upon request, R&S shall provide the User with the source code if the provision of the source code has been agreed in the conditions of use of the Open Source Software license.

Furthermore, R&S shall make no warranty that the Product is free from any third-party rights. The afore-mentioned exclusion of warranty shall not apply if and to the extent R&S fraudulently conceals a defect of title or material defect of the Product, in which case R&S shall be obliged to indemnify the User for damages resulting therefrom.  7. Product Support R&S offers a limited support for the Product at its sole discretion on voluntary basis and reserves the right to update the contents of the Product and its associated programs, files, documentation and/or other elements.  8.

KG free of charge (hereinafter referred to as \"Product\" or \"Products\"). All use of the Product is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below (hereinafter referred to as \"Terms and Conditions\").  To install the product, the User must first agree to the Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms and Conditions, installing or otherwise using any of the Product indicates the User’s acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.  1. Scope of these Terms and Conditions The User shall be entitled to view and download the Product including enhancements and documentations if any. The use of the Product shall be free of charge. The right to use the Product requires the prior acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.  If and to the extent the Product is provided to the User by ROHDE & SCHWARZ GmbH & Co. KG (hereinafter referred to as \"R&S\") in order to fulfill R&S’ warranty or non-gratuitous maintenance obligations under any other already existing agreement with the User, the use of the Product shall be governed by such other agreement.  2. Grant of License R&S grants to the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty free, perpetual right to use the Product for the sole purpose for which it is intended and provided by R&S.  The license granted hereunder is limited to R&S and R&S licensors' intellectual property rights in the Product. R&S reserves all rights not expressly granted hereunder to the User.  3. Restrictions The User shall not (i) copy the Product except for archival purposes or unless it is essentially required for its authorized use, (ii) modify, adapt or create derivative works of the Product or disable any of its features, (iii) remove, alter or obscure any product identification, copyright or other intellectual property notices embedded within or on the Product, or (iv) publish, disclose, sell, rent, lease, lend, distribute, make available online, sublicense or provide the Product to any third party without R&S' prior written consent. The User shall not decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Product unless stipulated otherwise by mandatory law.  4. Third Party Product / Open Source Software To the extent that the Product is provided to the User for which R&S has only derived rights to use (Third Party Product), the above Sections \"Grant of License\" and \"Restrictions\" shall – also concerning the relationship between R&S and the User – be amended and superseded by the conditions of use agreed between R&S and its licensor. To the extent that the User is provided with Open Source Software, the provisions of the above Sections \"Grant of License\" and \"Restrictions\" shall be amended and superseded by the conditions of use of the according Open Source Software. Upon request, R&S shall provide the User with the source code if the provision of the source code has been agreed in the conditions of use of the Open Source Software license. R&S shall point out in the contract documents or in any other appropriate document if Third Party Products (including, but not limited to Open Source Software) and pertaining conditions of use exist and shall make the conditions of use available if so requested by the User. Any breach of the conditions of use on the part of the User shall entitle not only R&S, but also its licensor, to assert claims and rights arising there from in their own name.  5.

Furthermore, R&S shall make no warranty that the Product is free from any third-party rights. The afore-mentioned exclusion of warranty shall not apply if and to the extent R&S fraudulently conceals a defect of title or material defect of the Product, in which case R&S shall be obliged to indemnify the User for damages resulting therefrom.  7. Product Support R&S offers a limited support for the Product at its sole discretion on voluntary basis and reserves the right to update the contents of the Product and its associated programs, files, documentation and/or other elements.  8.
